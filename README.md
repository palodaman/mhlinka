## ðŸŒŒ Get started

## 2. Set up environment variables

Before you take off, set up the required environment variables for both Strapi and Next.js.

To create the Strapi .env file, copy the content of the `./strapi/.env.example` file into a new file named `./strapi/.env`, then modify the values to match your setup:

```sh
cp ./strapi/.env.example ./strapi/.env
```

Then do the same for the Next.js .env file, and modify it too:

```sh
cp ./next/.env.example ./next/.env
```

## 3. Start Strapi

```
yarn && yarn seed && yarn develop
```

This will install dependencies, data magic, and run the server. (You can run these commands separately, but why not be efficient?)

## 4. Start Next.js

Next.js is your sleek, futuristic interface for getting all that glorious content out into the world. ðŸš€

Open a new terminal tab or window to leave Strapi running, and navigate to your `./my-projects/launchpad/next` folder by running `cd next`.

- Run the following command in your `./launchpad/next` folder

```
yarn && yarn build && yarn start
```

This installs dependencies, builds your project, and starts your server.

## Todo

- [ ] Populate creator fields when it'll work on Strapi 5 (article authors information are missing)

## Customization

- The Strapi application contains a custom population middleware in order to populate more data than what it is set by default. You can find it in the `./strapi/src/middlewares/deepPopulate.ts` file.

- The Strapi application contains a postinstall script that will regenerate an uuid for the project in order to get some anonymous usage information concerning this demo. You can disable it by removing the uuid inside the `./strapi/packages.json` file.

- The Strapi application contains a patch for the @strapi/admin package. It is only necessary for the hosted demos since we automatically create the Super Admin users for them when they request this demo on our website.
